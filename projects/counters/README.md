# Counters

For this Contribution Test, I want you to do the following for a specific programming language:
1. nothing: Do nothing. Time the runtime.
1. count8: Count to 0xff, no printing. Time the runtime.
2. count16: Count to 0xffff, no printing. Time the runtime.
3. count32: Count to 0xffffffff, no printing. Time the runtime.
4. count64: Count to 0xffffffffffffffff, no printing. Time the runtime, or say how long you ran without completion.
5. build: A build file to do the building of all of the above.
