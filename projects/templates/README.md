# templates
This ContributionTest accepts contributions in the form of premade templates for projects.

For example, an OpenGL project may have a particular template which may be modified to build your own OpenGL projects.

A template must follow the following layout:

- /&lt;template folder&gt;
  - README.md containing:
    - template description
    - target system.
    - instructions for building the project.
    - instructions for modifying the project.
  - relevant files
